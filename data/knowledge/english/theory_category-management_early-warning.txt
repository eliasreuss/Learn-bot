An "Early Warning System" (EWS) is a tool directly linked to the company's Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The system monitors products, categories, and suppliers, alerting to outliers and items requiring attention. This can include checklists for:
- End-of-life (EOL) products
- Items with negative Gross Margin
- New Fast Movers (new items selling quickly)
- New Slow Movers (new items selling slowly)
- Obsolete Inventory
