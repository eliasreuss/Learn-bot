AUBO set two main goals: reducing warehouse stock by 20% and creating a plan for dead stock management. Emphasis was on achieving the reduction target without impacting customers and finding responsible solutions for dead stock to meet ESG requirements and support material reuse philosophy. The importance of achieving these goals was highlighted by the need to balance efficiency with customer satisfaction.
