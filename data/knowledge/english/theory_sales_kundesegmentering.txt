Customer segmentation is a management tool used to ensure that the company focuses on the right customers. It clarifies which customers contribute the most to revenue (typically "Nurse/Protect" customers) and which are loss-making ("Turnaround" customers). The purpose is to strategically work on moving customers between segments. For example, by working on costs, a large but unhealthy customer ("Develop") can be moved to become large and healthy ("Nurse/Protect"), or by focusing on cross-selling, a small, healthy customer ("Grow") can be moved to become large and healthy.
