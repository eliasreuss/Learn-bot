Category work requires an overview of a product's life cycle, typically consisting of four phases: Introduction, Growth, Maturity, and Decline. To analyze the product mix, one can use a PLC Framework (Product Life Cycle), which often categorizes products as:  
- Cash Cow: High market share, low growth.  
- Star: High market share, high growth.  
- Question Mark: Low market share, high growth.  
- Dogs: Low market share, low growth.  

This framework helps clarify where and how to work with different products.
