Inact Actions are "alarms" designed to monitor your operations. An Action is a rule-based list that notifies you when something requires your attention and action. Actions are lists based on, for example, item numbers (or customers/suppliers), that meet specific criteria in the form of a filter. The list is updated daily and scans data to add or remove items.
