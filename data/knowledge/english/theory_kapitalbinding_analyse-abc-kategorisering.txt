The ABC analysis is a tool for analyzing inventory binding by categorizing items based on their importance to turnover. Typically, the Pareto principle (80/20 rule) applies:
- A category: Represents 80% of turnover (but often only 20% of item numbers). These are the most important items.
- B category: Represents 15% of turnover.
- C category: Represents 5% of turnover (but often a large share of item numbers). These can be "time wasters."
The analysis provides a strong indication of which items should be prioritized and protected.
