Content:
A Dashboard on your Homepage provides a quick overview of your organization's status. It consists of 4 elements:
- KPI: The key performance indicators you want to display.
- Target: A goal for each KPI that triggers an alarm.
- Alarm: Turns green if you exceed the target, red if you fall below, and blue if no target is set.
- Table: The table offers a drill-down overview of your KPIs. It is only visible when accessing the dashboard from the menu or if enabled in an email.
You can always click on a widget to view the underlying Insight.
