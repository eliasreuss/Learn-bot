To customize an Insight, you can set up filters and slicers.
- Insight Filter: Used by an Admin to delimit an Insight permanently. For example, a filter like "Buyer Equal(=) 1000" can delimit the Insight to only include item numbers belonging to that specific buyer.
- Fixed Slicer: Set up by an administrator to keep a specific slicer always fixed in the Insight menu. This allows future users to quickly filter by, for example, customer/supplier ID, product group, or responsible salesperson.
