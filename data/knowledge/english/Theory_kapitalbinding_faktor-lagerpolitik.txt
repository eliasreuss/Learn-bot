Inventory policy is about deciding which item numbers to stock. The answer depends on two factors: lead time and demand. A simple method is to assess items as follows:
- Items with high demand and long lead time should be inventory items.
- Items with high demand and short lead time can be either inventory items or procurement items (if the supplier can deliver day-to-day).
- Items with low demand and long lead time are risky to stock.
- Items with low demand and short lead time are ideal as procurement items to reduce risk.
