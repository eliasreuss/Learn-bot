Content:
A table in Dashboard Creator consists of rows (horizontal) and columns (vertical).
- Column: Represents the horizontal sections. Each row can contain a column from the selected Dataset (e.g., "Revenue 12 month"). You add a column by clicking "Add Column".
- Rows: Represents the vertical sections. The starting point is a "Master Insight" (Total Insight). From here, you can add benchmarks like Countries, Sellers, or Stores. You add a row using the "Add Row" button.
For all Insights, there will be a Master Insight associated, selected when creating a new Insight.
