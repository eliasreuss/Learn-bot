You can set goals (Targets) for your data in a table or directly on a Dashboard Widget. There are two types:
- Number target: A fixed, manually entered value.
- Table Target: A dynamic goal that points to another column in your table, adjusting based on real-time data.
Once a target is set, you can define a trend (positive/green or negative/red) to indicate whether the KPI is above or below the goal.
