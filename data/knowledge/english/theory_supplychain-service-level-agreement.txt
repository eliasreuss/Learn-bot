A Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a common set of rules translated into policies and control parameters across procurement, logistics, and sales. The purpose is to meet customer expectations at the lowest possible cost. A well-defined SLA addresses several factors for different product categories, including:
- Inventory policy (procurement or stocked item)
- Delivery reliability (percentage)
- Cost prices and order size (MOQ)
- Size of safety stock
- Inventory turnover
