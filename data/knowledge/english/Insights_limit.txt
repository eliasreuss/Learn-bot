It is possible to set a limit on an Insight to make it more manageable. You can choose to display a specific number of items (from 5 to 100) based on a top or bottom list.
Examples of popular lists:
- Top 25: Dead items measured by inventory value.
- Top 100: Customers measured by revenue.
- Bottom 50: Customers measured by contribution margin.
