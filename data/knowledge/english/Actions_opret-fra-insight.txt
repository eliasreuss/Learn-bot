You can create Actions directly from an Insight.
1. Start in the Insight you want to base your Action on.
2. Slice/filter to the items you want to create an alert for.
3. Press the checklist button (âœ” Create Checklist) to give your Action a name. If you do not want a limited Action (e.g., top 50), uncheck the "limit" checkbox.
You can also select specific items by holding down 'Ctrl' and clicking on the individual rows before creating the Action.
