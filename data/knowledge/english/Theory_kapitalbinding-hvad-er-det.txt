Capital tie-up in an inventory refers to the money tied up in the goods stored in inventory. It is an investment but poses a risk. Often, only the "tip of the iceberg" is visible â€“ the visible capital tie-up. The invisible capital tie-up, such as costs for storage space, handling, and the risk of obsolescence, is often much larger. 20-40% of a company's capital tie-up can often be released without disappointing customers if the right methods are used.
