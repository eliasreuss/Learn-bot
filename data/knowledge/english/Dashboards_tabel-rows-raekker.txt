When adding a row ("Add Row") in a table, you can choose from several types:
- Insight Row: Based on a filter from an existing Insight. This is useful as you can select data not in your Master Insight, and clicking the row in a widget takes you to the other Insight.
- Filter Row: Based on your Master Insight and a filter you create. Using slicers avoids the need to create separate Insights just for a single row in a dashboard.
- Multiple Filter Rows: Allows adding multiple filter rows at once, based on a single filter.
