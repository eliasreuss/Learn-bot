**Sales Strategy**
*Guide to Sales and Customer Service*

A "one-size-fits-all" strategy, where all customers are serviced on the same terms, is rarely profitable, as it often leads to overservicing some customer groups and underservicing others. To understand a customer's true profitability, one must look beyond the visible costs such as cost of goods sold. The hidden costs, such as inventory costs, shipping, order handling, customer service, and sales costs, must be included to reveal whether a high-revenue customer is truly a healthy business or if they are generating a loss.
