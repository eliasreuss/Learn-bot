Category Management's task is to ensure a "healthy and attractive assortment." With many movements, variants, and new products, a Category Management team needs an overview and tools to analyze the assortment and monitor the products' lifecycle. The goal is to identify and work on items that should be discontinued ("the long tail"), discover new product variants that are not performing, and closely follow products being phased in. This work often happens in dialogue with suppliers with the aim of phasing out and price optimization.
